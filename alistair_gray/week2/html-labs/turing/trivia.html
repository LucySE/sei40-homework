          <h2>Trivia</h2>
          <h3>CAPTCHA</h3>
          <p>Alan's work relating to cryptography and artificial intelligence set the basis for the future development of programs such as CAPTCHA. Turing's work is seen as developing ways to decipher whether a machine or a human is interacting with the test.</p>

          <h3>My great aunt's involvement</h3>
          <p>I have a family claim to fame, well sort of, involving my great aunt, Cynthia Leywood. She was a Typex Operator at Blechley and although it was an amazing experience for her, no one knew of her involvement until the late 90s. She was sworn to secrecy and to break her silience would have been considered treason. She had once said in our chats, before her passing, that she had been part of the construction of first prototype but I have yet to find evidence to her claim.</p>

          <p class="reveal">At an early age, Alan enjoyed developing and playing with ciphers with his childhood friend, Christopher Morcom. This was the first account of his interests in cryptography and set him up for his future endeavours in this field</p>
