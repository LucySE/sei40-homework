          <h2>about</h2>
          <p>Alan Turing of London, England, is seen as the father of modern computing and artificial intelligence. He has published many papers in subject areas ranging from mathematics to organic chemistry, most notably his paper, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mind/article/LIX/236/433/986238#164226651" target="_blank">Computing Machine and Intelligence</a>, which in my view, both challenges the heirachy of consciousness and its potential capability.</p>
          <br>
          <p>He is also known for his efforts during the second world war. Turing and a number of multi-disciplinary teams worked at a secret location known as Bletchley Park, in Buckinghamshire, England. Their purpose was to intercept adversarial transmissions from the German Reich and the Japanese Empire. These transmissions were encrypted by a state of the art machine known as Enigma.</p>
          <br>
          <p>To break Enigma, Turing and his team developed a series of prototypes that were designed to receive an input, being the encrypted message and use a series simultaneous of simultaneous calculations to decrypt the message. This was a huge undertaking, which ultimately led to a breakthrough of decrypting the Enigma messages. The first working prototype was known as The Bombe.</p>
