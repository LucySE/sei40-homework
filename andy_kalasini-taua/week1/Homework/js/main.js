// Homework: The Word Guesser

// Create two global arrays: one to hold the letters of the word (e.g. 'F', 'O', 'X'),
// and one to hold the current guessed letters (e.g. it would start with '_', '_', '_'
// and end with 'F', 'O', 'X').

const secretLetter = [
  'F',
  'O',
  'X'];

// const guessLetter = [
//   '_',
//   '_',
//   '_'];

 for ( let i = 0; i < secretLetter.length; i++ ){
    console.log(secretLetter[i]);
  }

// Write a function called guessLetter that will:
// Take one argument, the guessed letter.

// Iterate through the word letters and see if the guessed letter is in there.
// If the guessed letter matches a word letter, changed the guessed letters array
// to reflect that.
// When it's done iterating, it should log the current guessed letters ('F__')
// and congratulate the user if they found a new letter.
// It should also figure out if there are any more letters that need to be guessed,
// and if not, it should congratulate the user for winning the game.
// Pretend you don't know the word, and call guessLetter multiple times with various
// letters to check that your program works.
