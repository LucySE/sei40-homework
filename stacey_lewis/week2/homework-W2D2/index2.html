        <h1>Zach Lieberman</h1>
        <p>Zach is an artist with a simple goal: he wants you surprised. His work uses technology in a playful way to break down the fragile boundary between the visible and the invisible. He has held residencies at Ars Electronica Futurelab, Eyebeam, Dance Theater Workshop, and the Hangar Center for the Arts in Barcelona, and his work has been exhibited around the world. <br> <br> This site showcases two of his projects that interests me and a <a href="index_Sketch.html"> Javascript add-on sketch tool</a> that he utilised in is Drawing++ MIT class. <br> <br> I've also included links to his shopify site (where you can buy prints of his digital work), Instagram and and GitHub page.</p>
