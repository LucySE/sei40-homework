            <h1>What Turned Jaron Lanier Against the Web?</h1>
            <h3>The digital pioneer and visionary behind virtual reality has turned against the very culture he helped create</h3>

            <p>Couldn't help thinking of John Le Carré’s spy novels as I awaited my rendezvous with Jaron Lanier in a corner of the lobby of the stylish W Hotel just off Union Square in Manhattan. Le Carré’s espionage tales, such as The Spy Who Came In From the Cold, are haunted by the spectre of the mole, the defector, the double agent, who, from a position deep inside, turns against the ideology he once professed fealty to.</p>
            <p>And so it is with Jaron Lanier and the ideology he helped create, Web 2.0 futurism, digital utopianism, which he now calls "digital Maoism," indicting "internet intellectuals," accusing giants like Facebook and Google of being "spy agencies." Lanier was one of the creators of our current digital reality and now he wants to subvert the "hive mind," as the web world's been called, before it engulfs us all, destroys political discourse, economic stability, the dignity of personhood and leads to "social catastrophe." Jaron Lanier is the spy who came in from the cold 2.0.</p>
            <p>To understand what an important defector Lanier is, you have to know his dossier. As a pioneer and publicizer of virtual-reality technology (computer-simulated experiences) in the '80s, he became a Silicon Valley digital-guru rock star, later renowned for his giant bushel-basket-size headful of dreadlocks and Falstaffian belly, his obsession with exotic Asian musical instruments, and even a big-label recording contract for his modernist classical music. (As he later told me, he once "opened for Dylan." )</p>
