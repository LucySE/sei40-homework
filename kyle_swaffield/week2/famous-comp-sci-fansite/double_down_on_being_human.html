            <h2>What Turned Jaron Lanier Against the Web?</h2>
            <p>couldn't help thinking of John Le Carré's spy novels as I awaited my rendezvous with Jaron Lanier in a corner of the lobby of the stylish W Hotel just off Union Square in Manhattan. Le Carré's espionage tales, such as The Spy Who Came In From the Cold, are haunted by the spectre of the mole, the defector, the double agent, who, from a position deep inside, turns against the ideology he once professed fealty to.<a href="#">Read More</a></p>

            <h1>What Turned Jaron Lanier Against the Web?</h1>
            <h3>The digital pioneer and visionary behind virtual reality has turned against the very culture he helped create</h3>
<p>
            Jaron Lanier has written a book about virtual reality, a phrase he coined and a concept he did much to invent. It has the heady title Dawn of the New Everything. But it's also a tale of his growing up and when you read it, what you really want to talk to him about is parenting. Lanier is 57, but his childhood as he describes it was so sad and so creative and so extreme, it makes him almost seem fated to pursue alternative worlds.
</p><p>
            Lanier's parents met in New York. His mother, Lilly, blond and light-skinned and Jewish, had somehow talked her way out of a “pop-up concentration camp” in Vienna after the Anschluss, aged 15. The family of his father, Ellery, had escaped a murderous pogrom in Ukraine. They met as part of a circle of artists in Greenwich Village in the 1950s. Lilly was a painter and a dancer, Ellery an architect, but when Jaron was born in 1960 they moved to El Paso, Texas, right on the border with Mexico. Lanier was never sure why, but he believes it was an effort, given their own childhoods, to “live as obscurely as possible”, off grid. His mother did not trust American schooling, so he went across the border to a Montessori school in Mexico each day; then, after a change of heart, to a Texas public high school, where he was bullied.
</p><p>
            When Lanier was nearly 10, his mother was killed and his father severely injured in a car crash. The accident happened after his mother had seen Lanier assaulted by bullies on the way to school. He feared the two events were connected, that she had been anxious or distracted; much later he learned the car she was driving most likely had a fatal fault. After his mother’s death he fell ill with a succession of infections, including scarlet fever and pneumonia, which kept him in hospital for a year.
</p><p>
            Of his time living in the desert, he says 'It felt as if we were living in the frame and not the painting of the world'
            During this time their house in El Paso burned down and, unemployed and grieving and virtually penniless, his father bought a parcel of uninhabited land in the New Mexican desert for them to live on. Ellery allowed his son to design their new house, which he based on the geodesic domes of R Buckminster Fuller, all the rage with hippies. This was 1972. The dome took two years to construct, and in the meantime father and son lived in an army surplus tent, bone cold in winter, deep fried in summer. They never talked about his mother. Lanier still hated school, but developed a passion for music, and for technology.
</p><p>
            Their closest neighbours worked at the White Sands Missile Range, out in the desert. One was the astronomer Clyde Tombaugh, who had discovered Pluto as a young man and who taught Lanier to grind lenses, and let him play around with the homemade telescopes in his back yard. Almost unable to communicate with strangers, but with a precocious talent for maths, Lanier took classes at New Mexico State University aged 15 or 16, and then at 17 transferred to Bard college in New York, paying for tuition by selling goat cheese from a herd of goats he had bred.
</p><p>
            Returning to New Mexico, he fell in love and followed his girlfriend (whom he had serenaded on their first date, in a laundrette, with a Japanese bamboo flute) to California, where she finished with him. He found himself alone in the start-up land of Silicon Valley, with a head full of equations that didn’t all add up and a hankering for different worlds. At this point in his memoir, not surprisingly, Lanier turns outward to the reader: “You might be thinking by now that this book is a work of magical realism,” he suggests.
</p><p>
            Talking to him on the phone last week, I admit that I did have my doubts. He hoots, with his high laugh. “At the time,” he says of the desert years, “it felt almost as if we were living in the frame and not the painting of the world. My personal experience was so different from anything else, I couldn’t even compare, really.”

            Virtual reality by the Guardian

            Lanier now lives in Berkeley, California, with his wife, Lena, a child psychologist, their 11-year-old daughter, Lillibell, and more than a thousand musical instruments, ancient and modern, all of which he tries to play. Having made and lost a paper fortune with his pioneering virtual reality headsets, he sold an interest in another company involved in face recognition software to Google in 2006. Since then he has had an innovation lab at Microsoft, and become a prominent critic of the ways in which technology and social media have shaped our world (a criticism “driven more by fear than love”), most notably in his bestselling book You Are Not a Gadget.
</p><p>
            One aspect of that latter argument is a belief that we should never separate a discussion of technological advance from its human effect. In his previous writing, Lanier says, he has sometimes adopted a theoretical or abstract tone, as if issues around virtual worlds and artificial intelligence had an independent life of their own. He has used the autobiographical voice in the current book partly as a statement of intent. It wasn’t easy for him.
</p><p>
            “I kind of coped with my mother’s death and lots of other things by putting them out of [my] mind,” he says. “Having to encounter that again was difficult. But I am unhappy with the way that digital technology is influencing the world, and I think the solution is to double down on being human…”, which leaves Lanier no choice but to put himself all the way into his book.
</p><p>
            Perhaps one of the effects of that is to root his advances in virtual reality in very human psychology. At one point in the book, he recalls how he and his geeky friends used to fantasise about putting a “4D headset” on a baby immediately after birth and imagine the strangeness of the world it would experience. I wonder if his own parents had something of the same experimental impulse with the simpler tools they had to hand. He giggles again, but says that was probably down to the traumas of their own childhoods. “I think that people who have suffered horrible things do have some extra – almost magical – investment in their children,” he says. Even so, he is not sure that his father allowing him to design their desert home was the greatest idea. He admits he is a little nervous that someone will read his book and see it as a challenge: “I do want to remind people that the dome did subsequently collapse.”
</p><p>
            He also says that when he arrived in Silicon Valley he found like-minded twentysomethings among tech entrepreneurs and hackers: the children of commune dwellers and peace protesters, who had been brought up with the liberal regime of the childcare guru Dr Spock and who recognised no limits to imagination, and often ego. Counterculture fed directly into plutocratic tech culture.
