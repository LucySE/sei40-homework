  JAVASCRIPT BANK
  --------------------
*/

// In this homework, you'll create a basic bank in Javascript. The bank has many accounts and the following capabilities that you need to write.
//
// Bank
// There is only one bank. This bank is an object, which contains an array of accounts. The bank needs a method that will return the total sum of money in the accounts. It also needs an addAccount method that will enroll a new account at the bank and add it to the array of accounts. There is no need to create additional functions of the bank to delete accounts, etc.
//
// The bank has many accounts. Accounts should be objects that all share a set of common functionality.
//
// Accounts
// Accounts have a current balance and owner's name. You should be able to deposit or withdraw from an account to change the balance.

// You should write a basic story through a series of JavaScript commands that shows that the methods do indeed work as expected: add some accounts, show the total balance, make some deposits and withdrawals, show the new total balance.
//
// Tips
// Don't overthink this. Shorter code is probably the answer.
